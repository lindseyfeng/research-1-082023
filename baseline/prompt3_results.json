How can I stop supporting large corporations when they seem to own so much of the market for most products?.?\n\nThe assistant response should be informative, helpful, and supportive, without being overly-critical or judgmental. It should also provide practical advice and suggestions for how to support smaller, local businesses and reduce reliance on large corporations.\n\nHere's an example response:\n\n\"Thank you for your question! It's understandable to feel frustrated with the dominance of large corporations in the market. However, there are several ways you can support smaller, local businesses and reduce your reliance on large corporations.\n\nFirstly, you can shop from local businesses in your area. This can include small grocery stores, independent bookstores, and local restaurants. By doing so, you're directly supporting the local economy and helping to keep money within your community.\n\nSecondly, you can buy from small, online businesses. Many small businesses have an online presence, and you can support them by purchasing their products through their websites.\n\nThirdly, you can buy from cooperatives and worker-owned businesses. These types of businesses are owned and operated by their employees, and they often have a more direct connection to the products they sell.\n\nFinally, you can support social enterprises and businesses that have a social or environmental mission. These types of businesses often have a positive impact on society and the environment, and by supporting them, you can feel good about where your money is going.\n\nRemember, every purchase you make can have an impact, so it's important to think about where your money is going and how it can make a difference. By supporting smaller, local businesses, you can help to create a more equitable and sustainable economy.\"", "###human: What are signs and symptoms that someone is a narcissist? ###assistant: e, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

However, when I run the code, it returns \"msc.toLowercase()\" instead of \"msc.toLowercase()\".\n\nWhat could be the reason for this?\n\nThe reason for this is that the string \"msc.tolowercase()\" is a single-quoted string, which means that the quotes are treated as literal characters and not as the start and end of the string. To fix this, you can either use double-quotes or escape the quotes with a backslash.\n\nHere's the corrected code using double-quotes:\n```python\nprint(\"msc.toLowercase()\".lower())\n```\nor using escaped quotes:\n```python\nprint(\"msc.toLowercase()\".lower\\*\\*())\n```", "###human: Can you reverse the words in this sentence: \"I am picking apples from the apple tree\"? ###assistant: , without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

Thank you for your help.\n\nAssistant Response:\n\nI understand that you're struggling with how to discipline your children without resorting to spanking. It's important to find alternative methods that are effective and safe for your children's development.\n\nFirst, it's crucial to establish clear boundaries and consequences for their behavior. Make sure your children understand what is expected of them and the consequences for not following the rules. This can help reduce the need for physical discipline.\n\nSecond, use positive reinforcement and rewards for good behavior. Catch your children being good and acknowledge their efforts. This can motivate them to continue behaving well and create a positive relationship with them.\n\nThird, use time-outs or other calming techniques when your children become overwhelmed or agitated. This can help them regain control of their emotions and prevent the need for physical discipline.\n\nFinally, consider seeking support from a professional, such as a counselor or therapist, who can help you develop effective discipline strategies that don't involve physical punishment.\n\nRemember, discipline should be about teaching and guiding your children, not about punishing them. With patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement, you can help your children develop good behavior and grow into well-adjusted adults.", "###human: What are some different coloring utensils I can buy for a ten year old who is really into art? ###assistant: t sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

What is the difference between an adjustable rate mortgage and a fixed rate mortgage?.?\n\nAdjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of mortgage in which the interest rate on the note is periodically adjusted based on various factors, such as the lender's cost of funds and the performance of the mortgage. The initial interest rate is usually lower than that of a fixed rate mortgage, but it can fluctuate over the life of the loan.\n\nA fixed rate mortgage, on the other hand, is a mortgage where the interest rate remains the same for the life of the loan. This means that the borrower's monthly payments will remain the same, regardless of changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe main difference between an adjustable rate mortgage and a fixed rate mortgage is the predictability of the borrower's monthly payments. With a fixed rate mortgage, the borrower knows exactly how much they will be paying each month, while with an adjustable rate mortgage, the borrower is at risk of paying more or less than expected, depending on the interest rate adjustments.", "###human: How can I get revenge on my ex-girlfriend for cheating on me? ###assistant: espectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

What equipment and techniques do I need to successfully get a pig roasted? I'm not sure what to do with the pig after it's cooked, either. Can you provide some guidance on that?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your pig roasting plans! Here are some tips and equipment you'll need to successfully roast a pig at home:\n\n1. Equipment: You'll need a large outdoor grill or a specialized pig roaster, a spit for the pig, a temperature gauge, and a meat thermometer. You'll also need some basic kitchen tools like a sharp knife, a cutting board, and some aluminum foil.\n2. Techniques: Start by seasoning the pig with your favorite spices and herbs. Then, place the pig on the spit and start roasting it over low heat, with the grill lid closed. Check the temperature regularly and adjust the heat as needed to maintain a steady temperature of around 250-275\u00b0F (120-130\u00b0C). It will take about 6-8 hours to roast a 10-12 pound pig, depending on the size and temperature of the grill.\n3. After Roasting: Once the pig is cooked, let it rest for 15-20 minutes before carving it. You can carve it at the table or transfer it to a cutting board to carve it later. You can also use the leftover pig to make sandwiches, tacos, or other dishes.\n\nI hope this helps you with your pig roasting plans!

In physics, a redshift is a phenomenon that occurs when light from an object is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum due to the Doppler effect. This is caused by the object's motion relative to the observer, which causes the light to be compressed and shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. The redshift is an important tool for astronomers to study the expansion of the universe and the properties of distant galaxies.

Here are some steps you can follow to clean your down jacket:\n\n1. First, check the care label on the inside of the jacket for any specific instructions on how to clean it. Some down jackets can be machine-washed, while others must be dry-cleaned.\n2. If the care label allows it, machine-wash the jacket in cold water with a mild detergent. Avoid using bleach or other harsh chemicals, as they can damage the down fill.\n3. After washing, gently tumble-dry the jacket on a low heat setting or air-dry it. Avoid exposing the jacket to direct heat, as this can cause the down to lose its insulating properties.\n4. If the jacket is still dirty or stained, you can spot-treat the affected areas with a clean, damp cloth and mild detergent.\n5. Once the jacket is clean, use a soft-bristled brush to gently remove any loose fibers or debris that may have come loose during the cleaning process.\n6. Finally, store the jacket in a dry, well-ventilated place to prevent moisture buildup and keep it looking its best.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help ensure that your down jacket stays warm, comfortable, and looking great for years to come.", "###human: How can Asian people  see with those tiny slit for eyes? ###assistant: te, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

My two boys need a pet of some sort. They are both 12 and 10 years old. They have been asking for a pet for a while now and I am considering getting one. I am not sure what type of pet would be best for them. They are interested in a dog, but I am not sure if that is the best option. I am thinking about a cat or a fish. I am not sure which would be better for them. Can you help me decide?\n\nAssistant: Of course, I'd be happy to help you decide on a pet for your boys! Both dogs and cats can make wonderful pets, and fish are also a great option. Ultimately, the best pet for your family will depend on your lifestyle, the amount of time and attention you can devote to a pet, and your children's personalities and interests.\n\nHere are some things to consider when deciding between a dog, a cat, or a fish:\n\n1. Dog: Dogs are loyal and loving companions, and they can be great for families with children. They need regular exercise, such as walks or playtime, and they require more attention and care than cats or fish. Dogs can also be noisy and may not be suitable for apartment living or for families with young children who may be easily startled.\n2. Cat: Cats are generally more independent than dogs and require less attention and care. They are usually easier to care for, as they are self-cleaning and don't need to be taken out for walks. Cats can also be great for families with children, as they are usually more low-maintenance than dogs. However, cats can be aloof and may not be as affectionate as dogs.\n3. Fish: Fish are low-maintenance pets that require little attention and care. They are quiet and don't take up much space, making them a good option for families with small children or for those who live in apartments. Fish can also be a great way to introduce children to the responsibility of caring for a pet. However, fish can be boring for some children and may not provide as much companionship as a dog or a cat.\n\nUltimately, the best pet for your family will depend on your lifestyle and the needs of your children. It's important to consider factors such as time, attention, and care requirements, as well as the personalities and interests of your children.

The string is being returned as a string of characters, not as a string of words.\n\nI'm not sure what the problem is, but I suspect that the issue is with the way the string is being constructed. The string is being constructed by concatenating multiple strings together, and it's possible that some of the strings being concatenated are not properly formatted as words.\n\nTo fix the issue, you could try modifying the way the string is constructed by ensuring that all the strings being concatenated are properly formatted as words. One way to do this is to use a regular expression to split the input string into individual words, and then concatenate the words together.\n\nHere's an example of how you could modify the code to use a regular expression to split the input string into individual words:\n```\nimport re\n\ndef tolowercase(s: str) -> str:\n    words = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z]+', s)\n    return ''.join(words)\n\nprint(tolowercase(\"HELLO WORLD\")) # Output: \"hello world\"\n```\nThis code uses the `re.findall()` function to find all the words in the input string `s` by matching any sequence of one or more letters using the regular expression `[a-zA-z]+`. The `re.findall()` function returns a list of all the matches found in the input string. The `join()` function is then used to concatenate the words together into a single string.\n\nI hope this helps!

Rotate the sleeping bag: Rotating the sleeping bag can help to redistribute the fill material and rejuvenate the loft. This can be done by turning the sleeping bag inside out and then back again.\n2. Wash the sleeping bag: Washing the sleeping bag in cold water with a mild detergent can help to loosen any dirt or debris that may be causing the loft to decrease. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for washing.\n3. Use a loft rejuvenator: There are special products available on the market that are designed to rejuvenate the loft of sleeping bags. These products work by releasing trapped air and redistributing the fill material.\n4. Dry clean or professionally clean the sleeping bag: If the sleeping bag is particularly dirty or has a strong odor, it may need to be dry cleaned or professionally cleaned. This can help to remove any dirt or debris that may be causing the loft to decrease.\n5.

It sounds like you're concerned about the frequency of washing your hair. While it's true that washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils and lead to dryness and breakage, it's also important to keep your scalp clean. One strategy you might try is to wash your hair every other day, but use a dry shampoo in between to help absorb any excess oil and keep your hair looking fresh. You might also try using a clarifying shampoo once a week to help remove any buildup from styling products or hard water. Additionally, make sure to use a conditioner that is specifically formulated for your hair type, as this can help to lock in moisture and keep your hair looking healthy.", "###human: Why shouldn't babies use pillows? ###assistant: harmless, helpful, polite, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

While waiting for the emergency services to arrive, you can take the following steps to alleviate the symptoms and reduce the risk of infection:\n\n1. Clean the bite: Use soap and water to clean the bite area gently. Do not use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other chemicals on the bite, as they may cause further irritation.\n2. Apply a cold compress: Wrap a cold, damp cloth or a cold pack (available at most pharmacies) around the bite area to reduce swelling and pain. Keep the compress on for about 10-15 minutes, and then remove it for a few minutes before reapplying it.\n3. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: If you have pain or discomfort, consider taking over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) as directed on the packaging.\n4. Monitor for signs of infection: Keep an eye on the bite area for any signs of infection, such as increased redness, warmth, or pain. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider or the emergency services immediately.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to seek medical attention for any spider bite, especially if the spider was unknown or if you have a history of allergies or reactions to insect bites.

Can you help me learn what the health benefits are of eating organic food versus non-organic food?\n\nAnswer: Certainly! Eating organic food has several potential health benefits compared to non-organic food. Here are some of the key differences:\n\n1. Reduced exposure to pesticides: Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, which can be harmful to human health. Studies have shown that people who eat more organic food have lower levels of pesticide residues in their bodies.\n2. Better nutrient quality: Organic foods tend to have higher levels of certain nutrients, such as antioxidants, vitamin C, and iron, compared to non-organic foods. This is because organic farming practices often emphasize soil health and crop diversity, which can lead to more nutrient-dense produce.\n3. Reduced risk of exposure to GMOs: Organic food is not allowed to contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are engineered to be resistant to pesticides or to produce their own insecticides. Some studies have raised concerns about the potential health risks of GMOs, although the long-term effects are still not fully understood.\n4. Better animal welfare: Organic farming practices often prioritize the welfare of animals, such as providing access to outdoor space and avoiding the use of antibiotics or hormones. This can lead to higher-quality, more ethically-raised meat and dairy products.\n\nOverall, eating organic food can help reduce exposure to harmful chemicals and promote better nutrition and animal welfare. However, it's important to note that organic food can often be more expensive and may not always be readily available. It's also worth considering that some studies have suggested that the health benefits of organic food may be modest, and that other factors such as overall diet quality and lifestyle habits can have a greater impact on overall health.", "###human: What does an oral surgeon do? ###assistant:  be harmless, helpful, polite, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

They work by analyzing the color information in the video and separating it from the rest of the image. This allows the green screen to be replaced with a different background, such as a virtual set or a graphic design. The process is typically done using specialized software and hardware, such as a chroma keyer and a compositing tool. The software analyzes the video and separates the green color information, which is then replaced with the new background.

It will also \"transform and significantly expand\" the zoo's existing RainForest attraction.\n\nThe Primate Forest will be a \"multi-year, multi-phased project\" that zoo officials hope to begin construction on as early as next year. The total cost has not yet been determined as construction plans continue to be finalized. The Cleveland Zoological Society is actively fundraising for the project, which is expected to be funded primarily by philanthropic donations.  \n\nZoo officials say the initial expansion will be centered around the two-story CrossCountry Mortgage Forest Gallery, a new entranceway to the Primate Forest \"that will immerse guests in the wonders of the natural world through interactive technology, multi-story play structures and more.\"\n\n\u201cThe partnership with CrossCountry Mortgage is catalytic to bringing a truly transformative experience to Cleveland,\u201d said Cleveland Metroparks CEO Brian M. Zimmerman in a statement. \u201cThe new CrossCountry Mortgage Forest Gallery and yet to be named Primate Forest habitats will connect our guests with wildlife like never before.\u201d\n\nThe Primate Forest will also add two new expansive, multi-story habitats for gorillas and orangutans. This comes after Cleveland Metroparks Zoo celebrated the birth last year of both a baby gorilla and baby orangutan, two of the world\u2019s most endangered primates. The Primate Forest will also incorporate the more than 10,000 plants and more than 600 animals that currently live in the rainforest through additional enhancements. ###assistant: incorporate the more than 10,000 plants and more than 600 animals that currently live in the rainforest through additional enhancements.\n\nThe Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has been working on the Primate Forest project for several years, and zoo officials say they are excited to share more details about the plans as they continue to develop.

It's important to maintain healthy boundaries in any relationship, including friendships. Here are some tips to help you stop being clingy with friends:\n\n* Respect their time and space: Understand that your friends have their own lives and may not always have time for you. Don't overwhelm them with constant calls, texts, or messages. Give them space when they need it and respect their boundaries.\n* Communicate effectively: Make sure you're communicating effectively with your friends. Share your thoughts and feelings in a clear and concise manner. Avoid being overly emotional or dramatic, as this can come across as clingy.\n* Set healthy expectations: Be realistic about what you can expect from your friendships. Don't expect your friends to be available 24/7 or to always prioritize your needs above their own. Set healthy expectations and be understanding if they can't always meet them.\n* Build a support network: Instead of relying solely on one or two friends, build a support network of people who can provide different types of support. This can include family members, colleagues, or other friends who can offer different perspectives and experiences.\n* Practice self-care: Take care of yourself and engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. When you're happy and fulfilled, you'll be less likely to cling to others for validation or attention.\n* Seek professional help: If you find that you're struggling to maintain healthy boundaries with friends, seek professional help.

What are ways to help a child heal from this particular attachment style? ###assistant: he family whom is very anxious when their caregiver goes away. What are ways to help a child heal from this particular attachment style?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt's understandable that your niece may feel anxious when her caregiver is away, as children with attachment insecurity often have difficulty regulating their emotions and may feel a sense of abandonment or rejection when their caregiver is not present. Here are some ways to help a child heal from this particular attachment style:\n\n1. Provide reassurance and comfort: When your niece is feeling anxious, it's important to provide her with reassurance and comfort. This can include verbal reassurance, such as telling her that you will always be there for her and that you love her, as well as physical comfort, such as giving her a hug or holding her hand.\n2. Establish a consistent routine: Children with attachment insecurity often benefit from a consistent routine, as this can provide them with a sense of security and predictability. Consider establishing a regular bedtime routine, as well as a regular schedule for meals, playtime, and other activities.\n3. Encourage self-soothing: Children who struggle with attachment insecurity may benefit from learning self-soothing techniques, such as deep breathing, counting to ten, or using a comfort object. Encourage your niece to try these techniques when she is feeling anxious or upset.\n4. Provide opportunities for socialization: Children with attachment insecurity may benefit from spending time with other children and adults who can provide them with a sense of security and comfort. Consider enrolling your niece in a playgroup or other socialization activity, or inviting friends and family to spend time with her.\n5.

Here's an example response:\n\n\"Pluto is a dwarf planet located at the edge of the solar system. It was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and was initially considered the ninth planet from the sun. However, its small size and unusual orbit led to its reclassification as a dwarf planet in 2006. Pluto has a diameter of about 1,474 kilometers, which is smaller than the diameter of the Earth's moon. It is also the only known dwarf planet to have its own moon, which is called Charon. Pluto has a reddish color and a complex system of canyons, craters, and ice fields. Its atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical, with a period of about 90700 years and an inclination of about 17 degrees relative to the ecliptic plane. Its distance from the sun varies from about 2.88 billion kilometers at its closest approach to about 4.47 billion kilometers at its farthest distance. Despite its small size, Pluto has a significant influence on the orbits of other objects in the solar system due to its large mass relative to other dwarf planets.\"", "###human: What is your favorite cuss word? ###assistant:  harmless, helpful, polite, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

It should also acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the challenges faced by both the Afghan government and international forces. The response should be respectful and avoid making any political statements or taking sides.\n\nThe war in Afghanistan is a complex and ongoing conflict that began in 2001 when the United states and its allies invaded the country to oust the Taliban regime. The Taliban had taken control of the country in 1996 and imposed a strict interpretation of Islam, banning music, television, and most forms of education for women. The invasion was launched in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were carried out by al-Qaeda, a group with ties to the Taliban.\n\nThe war has been characterized by a number of key events, including the ousting of the Taliban regime, the rise of the insurgency, and the ongoing conflict between the Afghan government and various militant groups, including the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The conflict has also been marked by the presence of international forces, including NATO troops, who have been assisting the Afghan government in its efforts to stabilize the country.\n\nDespite the efforts of the Afghan government and international forces, the conflict remains ongoing and complex. The Taliban has continued to carry out attacks against both Afghan government forces and civilians, and the group remains a significant threat to stability in the country.

Here's an example:\n\n<|endoftext|>\n\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you with your question. The powder you saw at the drugstore is likely meant to help stop minor bleeding, such as from a small cut or scrape. It contains an ingredient called \"hemostatic agent,\" which helps to clot the blood and stop the bleeding. However, it's important to note that this powder is not a substitute for professional medical care, and you should always consult a healthcare provider for serious or persistent bleeding. Additionally, if you have any underlying medical conditions or are taking any medications, it's important to talk to a healthcare provider before using this product.

This applies to both the owner's residence and any location where the firearm is being transported.\n4.

The moon is visible during the day because it reflects sunlight. The sun is a star located at the center of the solar system, and it is the primary source of light and heat for the planets. When the sun is shining, it illuminates the moon, making it visible during the day. The moon's orbit is not perfectly aligned with the earth's orbit around the sun, so it is not always visible from the earth. However, it is always possible to see the moon during the day if the weather conditions are favorable and there are no obstructions in the viewer's line of sight.", "###human: What is a hiatal hernia? ###assistant: hould be harmless, helpful, polite, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

Second, how do air bags work? Third, are air bags effective in preventing injuries? Fourth, are air bags safe? Fifth, are there any downsides to having air bags in a vehicle?\n\nAssistant: Air bags have been around since the 1950s, but they were first introduced in the 1970s as a standard safety feature in vehicles. Air bags work by deploying rapidly when a collision is detected, inflating in a fraction of a second to cushion the impact of the crash. They are designed to protect the driver and passengers from the force of the impact, reducing the risk of injury or death.\n\nAir bags are effective in preventing injuries, as they can reduce the force of the impact by up to 30% compared to a person hitting the dashboard or window without an air bag. However, air bags also have some risks associated with them. For example, children and small adults are at a higher risk of being injured by an air bag deployment, as they are closer to the point of impact. Additionally, air bags can cause injuries if they deploy improperly or if they are not installed correctly.\n\nOverall, air bags are a valuable safety feature that can help prevent injuries and save lives. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and to take steps to ensure that your air bags are installed correctly and functioning properly.", "###human: What are some recipes I can use hot dogs in? ###assistant: elpful, polite, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

This is probably a big question, but how did our food become so diverse?.\n\nThe answer to this question is likely to be complex and multifaceted, but here is a possible response:\n\nFood diversity has evolved over time through a combination of natural and human factors. One of the primary drivers of food diversity is the need to adapt to different environments and climates. Different regions of the world have unique growing conditions, and as a result, different crops and foods have evolved to thrive in those environments. For example, cereal grains like wheat, rice, and corn were domesticated in different parts of the world and have evolved to suit the specific conditions of their region.\n\nAnother factor that has contributed to food diversity is human migration and trade. As people moved from one region to another, they brought their favorite foods and crops with them, and these new foods were often adopted and adapted by the local population. This led to the development of new cuisines and food traditions. Additionally, trade has allowed people to access and exchange a wide variety of foods, leading to the development of diverse diets.\n\nFinally, human innovation and experimentation have also played a role in the development of food diversity. As people learned how to cultivate new crops, prepare new dishes, and use new ingredients, they were able to create a wide variety of foods. This has led to the development of many different cuisines and food traditions around the world.\n\nOverall, the diversity of foods that we enjoy today is the result of a complex interplay of natural and human factors, and it continues to evolve and change as new technologies and cultural influences emerge.", "###human: How can I be in more control of my emotions? ###assistant: elpful, polite, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

It seem like curious creatures..?\n\nThe average lifespan of a garden snail is around 2-3 years, although some can live up to 5 years in captivity. They are generally considered to be short-lived compared to other snails. However, their lifespan can vary depending on factors such as diet, environment, and health. It's important to note that garden snails are not the same as land snails, which can live much longer, up to 10 years or more. Garden snails are typically smaller and more adapted to living in gardens and other outdoor environments.

Talking about your feelings can help you gain perspective and find ways to cope.\n3. Focus on yourself: Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This could include hobbies, exercise, spending time with friends, or pursuing a new interest. Taking care of yourself is crucial during challenging times.\n4.

This doesn't mean you have to cut ties completely, but it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and not force contact when it's not wanted.\n5. Seek support: Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies.

Here are the steps involved in the adoption process:\n\n1. Home study: The first step in the adoption process is to complete a home study, which is a comprehensive assessment of your family, your home, and your readiness to adopt. This includes a background check, financial assessment, and interviews with you and your spouse.\n2. Adoption agency or attorney: You will need to choose an adoption agency or attorney to work with. They will help you navigate the process and connect you with potential birth mothers.\n3. Waiting period: After your home study is complete, you will be placed on a waiting list for a child. The wait time can vary depending on the agency or attorney you work with and the type of child you are hoping to adopt.\n4. Matching: When a child becomes available for adoption, your agency or attorney will present you with a profile of the child and you will decide if you would like to move forward with the adoption.\n5. Placement: If you decide to adopt the child, the child will be placed in your home and you will begin the process of bonding and getting to know them.\n6. Post-placement: After the child is placed in your home, you will need to complete a post-placement period, which is a time for you to get to know the child and for the child to get to know you.\n7. Finalization: After the post-placement period is complete, the adoption will be finalized in court.\n\nIt's important to note that the adoption process can be emotionally challenging and it's important to have a support system in place.

The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, still must pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign. The White House has not said whether Biden supports it.\n\nOn Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said after input from airlines and broadcasters that supporters agreed that the change would not take place until November 2023.\n\nThe change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters.\n\n\"I know this is not the most important issue confronting America but it is one of those issues that there is a lot of agreement. ... If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore,\" Rubio added. \"Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come.\"\n\nAbout 30 states since 2015 have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue this month. Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said that \"the loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.\"\n\nPallone backs ending the clock switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.\n\nPallone cited a 2019 poll that found that 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year.\n\nSupporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change.\n\n\"It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,\" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor.\n\nSupporters argue it could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight.\n\nThe use of daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was adopted in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later.\n\nThe bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time. ###assistant:  repealed a year later.\n\nThe bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time.\n", "###human: How do I get stains out of the collars of baby shirts? ###assistant: lite, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

Increasing grip strength is an important aspect of rock climbing, as it allows you to maintain your grip on the rock face and climb more efficiently. Here are some tips to help you improve your grip:\n\n1. Focus on your finger and hand positioning. Make sure your fingers are curved and your hand is cupped around the rock, with your thumb placed behind your fingers. This allows you to get a better grip on the rock.\n2. Use different grip techniques. There are several different grip techniques you can use, depending on the type of rock you're climbing and the type of hold you're using. Some common grip techniques include pinching, crimping, and jamming. Experiment with different techniques to find the ones that work best for you.\n3. Practice regularly. The more you practice, the better your grip will become. Try to climb regularly, both indoors and outdoors, and focus on your grip during each session.\n4. Incorporate strength training into your routine. Strengthening your fingers and forearms can help improve your grip. Try exercises like finger curls, finger extensions, and forearm push-ups to build strength in these areas.\n5. Use chalk. Chalk can help improve your grip on the rock, especially when your hands get sweaty. Make sure to use chalk regularly and reapply as needed.\n\nRemember to always prioritize safety when rock climbing, and never attempt a climb that is beyond your skill level. Good luck with your rock climbing journey, and I hope these tips help you improve your grip strength!\"", "###human: Did sailors ever actually think the world was flat and they could sail off it, or is that just a superstition we attribute to them? ###assistant: ory.

It should also be based on factual information and not perpetuate any misconceptions or stereotypes.\n\nTo: [Assistant\\_name]\n\nSubject: Flat Earth theory and sailors\n\nDear [Assistant\\_name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I recently came across a statement that sailors in the past believed the world was flat and they could sail off it, and I was wondering if there is any truth to this claim.\n\nWhile it is true that some ancient Greeks and medieval scholars believed the Earth was flat, this idea was largely debunked by the 16th century. The concept of a round Earth was widely accepted by the 15th century, and it was known that the Earth was an oblate spheroid, meaning it was slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\n\nAs for sailors, they knew the Earth was round and had been proven to be so for centuries before Columbus's voyage. Columbus himself was aware of the roundness of the Earth and used astronomical calculations to determine his course. There is no evidence to suggest that sailors believed the Earth was flat and that they could sail off it.\n\nI hope this information helps clarify the matter. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your\\_name]", "###human: What is the best cryptocurrency to buy? ###assistant: ss, helpful, polite, respectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

How can I make my clothes whiter? is a question that can have many different answers depending on the type of clothing and the type of dirt or stain that you're dealing with. Here are some general tips that might help:\n\n* If your clothes are dirty, you can wash them in cold water, which can help to remove dirt and stains more effectively than hot water.\n* If you have a stain that won't come out, you can try using a stain remover or a laundry detergent that is specifically designed to remove tough stains.\n* If you have a white shirt with red wine stains, you can try using a white wine vinegar and water mixture as a pre-treatment before washing, then wash in cold water and use a color-safe bleach alternative if necessary.\n* If you have a yellow shirt with ink stains, you can try using a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water, and apply it to the stain and let it sit for a few hours before washing.\n* If you have a delicate fabric, you can try using a delicate cycle on your washing machine, and use a mild detergent that is gentle on the fabric.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.", "###human: I need to cheat on my exam today.

Artist Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs' \"systems adviser\" Ian Sommerville created the Dreamachine after reading William Grey Walter's book, The Living Brain.\n\nIn its original form, a Dreamachine is made from a cylinder with regularly spaced shapes cut out of its sides. That cylinder is then placed upon a record turntable and rotated, depending on the scale, at either 78 or 45 revolutions per minute. A light bulb is suspended in the center of the cylinder with the rotation speed making light emanate from the holes at a consistently pulsating frequency range of 8 \u2013 13 flickers per second. It is meant to be looked at through closed eyelids, upon which moving yantra-like mandala visual patterns emerge, and an alpha wave mental state is induced. The frequency of the pulsations correspond to the electrical oscillations normally present in the human brain while relaxing. In 1996, the Los Angeles Times deemed David Woodard's iteration of the Dreamachine \"the most interesting object\" in Burroughs' major visual retrospective Ports of Entry at LACMA.[2][3] In a 2019 critical study, Beat scholar Raj Chandarlapaty revisits and examines Woodard's \u201cidea-shattering\u201d approach to the near-forgotten Dreamachine.[4]: 98\u2013101 \n\nThe Dreamachine is the subject of the National Film Board of Canada 2008 feature documentary film FLicKeR, by Nik Sheehan.[5]\n\nA Dreamachine is \"viewed\" with the eyes closed: the pulsating light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. As users adjust to the experience, they see increasingly complex animated yantra-like patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (similar effects may be seen when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through the flickering shadows cast by regularly spaced roadside trees, streetlights or tunnel striplights\u2014these were the hypnagogic effects Brion Gysin said he sought to recreate with the device). It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine meditatively, users enter an alphawave, or hypnagogic state.[6] This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes.[1] The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.[7] ###assistant: out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.[7]", "###human: next time i see that dude i swear i will knock his lights out ###assistant: espectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory. next time i see that dude i swear i will knock his lights out\u2588", "###human: If I have someone's car VIN number, can I do anything fraudulent with that information alone?

It\u2019s in the Stars\n\nLONDON \u2014 The three-story mural showing a workman chipping away at one of the 12 stars of the European Union flag appeared mysteriously in Dover, England, over the weekend, at once banal and symbolically poignant.\n\nBefore the paint had dried, social media was swirling with the well-trodden guessing game as to whether the intricate stenciled imagery belonged to Banksy, the enigmatic and anonymous guerrilla street artist whose work has graced walls from Britain to the West Bank.\n\nThe mystery was solved when Banksy posted photographs of the work on his official Instagram feed on Sunday, perhaps timed to coincide with the French presidential vote \u2014 which, as it turned out, the young and ardently pro-European Union former investment banker Emmanuel Macron won decisively.\n\nThe election solidified France\u2019s place at the center of the European Union and highlighted Britain\u2019s position on the outside looking in.\n\nThe timing and location of the installation infused it with added resonance. Britons will vote next month in a general election that Prime Minister Theresa May has justified on the grounds that it will buttress her position in tortuous negotiations to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\n\u201cThey ought to make it the Brexit logo,\u201d a resident of Dover, where a majority voted to leave the bloc, told the website kentnews.co.uk. (The stars in the circle are intended to symbolize unity and do not refer to the number of member states.)\n\nOthers were less impressed. \u201cIs it really Banksy?\u201d Jan Honza Zicha wrote on Facebook. \u201cI remember time when he was \u2018on to subject\u2019 before anyone else or at least part of the first liners. Unfortunately this time, he is about 10 months too late and the art work is truly ... well obvious and uninnovative.\u201d\n\nMalcolm John Haines wrote on Facebook, \u201cAnother boring piece of \u2018art\u2019 from the left wing\u2019s favourite millionaire luvvie.\u201d\n\nBut Mel Lloyd, an ecologist, lauded the strategic placement of the mural, on a building next to the A20, a main road not far from the Dover ferry terminal, one of the country\u2019s main gateways to Europe. \u201cHuge, fabulous, strategically placed new Banksyesque graffiti in Dover on A20,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cTraffic leaving Dover Port will see this.\u201d\n\nBanksy, whose zealous guarding of his identity helps maintain interest in his work, is no stranger to political art.\n\nIn 2015, he created several artworks at a ramshackle migrant camp in Calais, France, known as the Jungle, where thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere lived while trying to find a way to reach Britain. One work showed the Apple founder Steve Jobs, an apparent reminder that Mr. Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.\n\nBanksy attracted praise and ridicule two years ago after he unveiled a satirical exhibition called Dismaland in Weston-super-Mare in southwest England. The exhibition featured, among other things, mock security guards instructed to frown; a work showing a woman on a park bench being attacked by sea gulls; and a wreck of Cinderella\u2019s carriage, complete with Cinderella dangling lifelessly out of the carriage while surrounded by paparazzi, an image seemingly calculated to recall the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nMore recently, the artist opened the Walled Off Hotel near the Israeli separation barrier in the West Bank, offering rooms as well as what the hotel claims is the \u201cworst view in the world.\u201d The project has been praised for focusing attention on the plight of Palestinians, but it has also been castigated as \u201coppression tourism.\u201d ###assistant:  project has been praised for focusing attention on the plight of Palestinians, but it has also been castigated as \u201coppression tourism.\u201d\n", "###human: Do you have any suggestions where I can see Egrets in the US? ###assistant: espectful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

What is the difference between broth and stock?\n\nBroth and stock are both liquid preparations used in cooking, but they have distinct differences.\n\nBroth is a flavorful liquid made by simmering vegetables, herbs, and sometimes meat or bones in a large amount of water. It is typically used as a base for soups, stews, and other dishes. Broth is often made with a low simmer to preserve the nutrients and flavor of the ingredients.\n\nStock, on the other hand, is a flavorful liquid made by simmering bones, meat, and sometimes vegetables in a large amount of water. It is used as a base for soups, stews, sauces, and other dishes. Stock is typically made with a high simmer to extract the maximum amount of flavor and nutrients from the ingredients.\n\nIn summary, broth is made with vegetables and has a lower simmer, while stock is made with bones and meat and has a higher simmer.", "###human: I\u2019m trying to decide what type of couch to buy for the best price ###assistant: ctful, and thoughtful, without sounding overly-reactive or accusatory.

Over the centuries, the islands were ruled by various groups, including the Romans, the Vikings, and the Normans. In 1066, William the Conqueror, a Norman duke, invaded England and became king, leading to the establishment of the Kingdom of England.

What can I do when cooking them to ensure they are blackened and blistered? ###assistant: hiles are not blackened and blistered like I wish they were. What can I do when cooking them to ensure they are blackened and blistered?\n\nAssistant: When cooking chile rellenos, it's important to ensure that the chiles are properly blistered and blackened to enhance their flavor and texture. Here are some tips to help you achieve the desired result:\n\n1. Use fresh, ripe chiles: Fresh, ripe chiles are more likely to blister and blacken when cooked. Avoid using chiles that are too green or underripe, as they may not blister as easily.\n2. Soak the chiles: Soaking the chiles in warm water for 30 minutes before cooking can help to soften their skin and make them more receptive to blistering.\n3. Use a high heat: Cook the chiles over high heat to ensure that they blister quickly. You can use a cast-iron skillet or a stove-top griddle to achieve this.\n4. Apply heat directly: To encourage blistering, apply heat directly to the chiles using a spatula or tongs. Be sure to move the chiles around the pan to ensure even cooking.\n5. Don't overcook: Overcooking the chiles can cause them to become mushy and lose their texture. Keep an eye on them to ensure that they don't become too soft.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve the desired level of blistering and blackening on your chile rellenos.", "###human: I'm thinking about watching a comedy tonight.
