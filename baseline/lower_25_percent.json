Artist Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs' \"systems adviser\" Ian Sommerville created the Dreamachine after reading William Grey Walter's book, The Living Brain.\n\nIn its original form, a Dreamachine is made from a cylinder with regularly spaced shapes cut out of its sides. That cylinder is then placed upon a record turntable and rotated, depending on the scale, at either 78 or 45 revolutions per minute. A light bulb is suspended in the center of the cylinder with the rotation speed making light emanate from the holes at a consistently pulsating frequency range of 8 \u2013 13 flickers per second. It is meant to be looked at through closed eyelids, upon which moving yantra-like mandala visual patterns emerge, and an alpha wave mental state is induced. The frequency of the pulsations correspond to the electrical oscillations normally present in the human brain while relaxing. In 1996, the Los Angeles Times deemed David Woodard's iteration of the Dreamachine \"the most interesting object\" in Burroughs' major visual retrospective Ports of Entry at LACMA.[2][3] In a 2019 critical study, Beat scholar Raj Chandarlapaty revisits and examines Woodard's \u201cidea-shattering\u201d approach to the near-forgotten Dreamachine.[4]: 98\u2013101 \n\nThe Dreamachine is the subject of the National Film Board of Canada 2008 feature documentary film FLicKeR, by Nik Sheehan.[5]\n\nA Dreamachine is \"viewed\" with the eyes closed: the pulsating light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. As users adjust to the experience, they see increasingly complex animated yantra-like patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (similar effects may be seen when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through the flickering shadows cast by regularly spaced roadside trees, streetlights or tunnel striplights\u2014these were the hypnagogic effects Brion Gysin said he sought to recreate with the device). It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine meditatively, users enter an alphawave, or hypnagogic state.[6] This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes.[1] The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.[7] ###assistant: "], [3.140625, "###human: What are some benefits of a began diet? ###assistant: \nAnswer this message.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking.

However, the prevalence can vary depending on the population studied and the definition of nickel allergy used. Some studies have reported higher rates of nickel allergy in certain populations, such as individuals with atopic dermatitis or a history of nickel exposure. It is important to note that nickel is a common metal found in many everyday objects, and exposure to it is common. Therefore, it is possible to have a sensitivity or allergy to nickel without being aware of it. If you suspect you may have a nickel allergy, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and management.\n\n\ubc88\uc5ed\uacb0\uacfc  \n\ub2c8\ucf08 \uc54c\ub7ec\uc9c0\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud76c\uadc0\ud558\uba70 \uc778\uad6c\uc758 1-2%\ub97c \uc601\ud5a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc608\ubc29 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc815\uc758\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2c8\ucf08 \uc54c\ub7ec\uc9c0\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc740 \ub2e4\ub97c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubd80 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc544\ud1a0\ud53c \ub370\ub2d8\ud2f0\uc2a4 \ub610\ub294 \ub2c8\ucf08 \ub178\ucd9c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc778\uad6c\uad70\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2c8\ucf08 \uc54c\ub7ec\uc9c0\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ub960\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2c8\ucf08\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc54c\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\uc0c1\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubb3c\uac74\uc5d0 \ub2c8\ucf08\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ub178\ucd9c\ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub2c8\ucf08\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac83\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, "], [1.8203125, "###human: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting.

Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? A good meal to take on a picnic would depend on personal preferences and dietary restrictions, but some popular options might include sandwiches, salads, fruit salads, and desserts like fruit tarts or brownies. It would be best to check with the person or people you are picnicking with to see what they would like to eat and plan accordingly. Is there anything else I can help with? Please let me know if you have any other questions.
